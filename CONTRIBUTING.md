- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
- Follow the JavaScript and CSS styleguides
- Include adequate tests
- Document new code based on the Documentation Styleguide
- End all files with a newline
## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid using `any` type; use proper type definitions
- Use generics where appropriate
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use type guards for type narrowing
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

### React Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- Optimize event handlers with `useCallback`
- Use React.memo for pure components
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop typing
- Follow the React component lifecycle

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers
- Support reduced motion preferences

## Testing

### Testing Philosophy

At TailGrid, we believe in thorough testing to ensure component reliability, performance, and accessibility. Our testing strategy includes:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
- **Visual Regression Tests**: To prevent UI regressions
- **Accessibility Tests**: To ensure inclusive design
- **Performance Tests**: To maintain optimal performance

### Test Coverage Requirements

- All new features must include appropriate tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage for new code
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

```
## Documentation

### Documentation Philosophy

At TailGrid, we believe that excellent documentation is as important as the code itself. Well-documented components are more accessible, easier to use, and lead to better developer experiences. Our documentation aims to be:

- **Comprehensive**: Covering all features and use cases
- **Clear**: Written in simple, understandable language
- **Practical**: Including useful examples and demos
- **Maintainable**: Kept up-to-date with the codebase

### Documentation Structure

The TailGrid documentation consists of:

1. **README.md**: Project overview, quick start, and basic usage
2. **API Reference**: Detailed component props and methods
3. **Examples**: Code samples for common use cases
4. **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials for specific scenarios
5. **JSDoc Comments**: In-code documentation
6. **Storybook**: Interactive component demos

### Documentation Standards

#### README.md

The README should include:

- Project description and purpose
- Installation instructions
- Basic usage example
- Key features
- Browser compatibility
- License information
- Link to full documentation

#### Component Documentation

Each component should have:

- Description of its purpose
- Props table with types, defaults, and descriptions
- Basic usage example
- Advanced configuration examples
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance notes (if applicable)

#### Props Documentation Format

```tsx
/**
 * TailGrid component for displaying tabular data with advanced features
 * 
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <TailGrid
 *   initialData={data}
 *   columns={columns}
 *   pagination={true}
 * />
 * ```
 */
export interface TailGridProps<T extends Record<string, unknown>> {
  /**
   * Initial data to display in the table
   * @default []
   */
  initialData?: T[];
  
  /**
   * Column configuration defining how to display the data
   * @required
   */
  columns: ColumnConfig<T>[];
  
  /**
   * Whether to enable pagination controls
   * @default true
   */
  pagination?: boolean;
  
  // ... other props
}

```
